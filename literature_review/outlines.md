# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outline

## Unit 2 – Literature Review Outline: Security Risks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

### 1. Working Title
"Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): Challenges, Frameworks, and Governance Approaches"

### 2. Introduction and Rationale
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates connected sensors, control systems, and cloud platforms across critical infrastructure, enabling efficiency and automation. However, this interconnectivity expands the attack surface of operational technology (OT) systems. Cyber incidents targeting industrial environments—such as TRITON and Stuxnet—demonstrate the real-world impact of vulnerabilities within safety-critical systems. This review aims to synthesise existing academic and regulatory research to identify common risk factors and governance gaps in IIoT ecosystems.

### 3. Aims and Objectives
The purpose of the literature review is to:
- Identify and analyse key cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities affecting IIoT environments
- Evaluate existing frameworks and standards (e.g., NIST, IEC 62443, ENISA, NIS 2 Directive, and the EU Cyber Resilience Act)
- Examine organisational and regulatory approaches to IIoT risk management
- Highlight gaps in current governance and propose areas for future research or improvement

### 4. Methodology
A qualitative research approach will be used, drawing on secondary data sources such as academic papers, technical standards, regulatory documents, and industry reports. The literature will be gathered from databases including IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink. A thematic analysis method will be applied to identify recurring patterns in risks, frameworks, and mitigation strategies.

### 5. Data Collection
No primary data will be collected. The review will rely entirely on secondary sources, focusing on peer-reviewed studies, official regulatory texts, and white papers from cybersecurity agencies such as ENISA and NIST. The inclusion criteria will prioritise publications from the past ten years to ensure contemporary relevance.

### 6. Expected Outcomes
The review is expected to deliver:
- A structured synthesis of IIoT security challenges and mitigation frameworks
- A comparative assessment of international standards and EU regulatory initiatives
- A conceptual mapping of governance gaps between IT and OT security domains
- Insights that could inform both future academic research and practical cybersecurity policy development

### 7. Skills to Develop
The main skills required include academic research and synthesis, critical analysis of technical standards, and the ability to translate regulatory requirements into cybersecurity governance insights. These competencies will be instrumental for later modules and the MSc capstone project.
