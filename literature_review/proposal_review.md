## Unit 3 – Research Proposal Review: DevSecOps under DORA

The subsequent research proposal builds on the earlier literature review but shifts focus to regulated software delivery in financial services. Entitled “DevSecOps under DORA: A Framework for Secure and Resilient Software Delivery in Financial Services,” it explores how the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) can be operationalised through secure-by-design principles and modern DevSecOps practices.

A mixed-method approach was identified as suitable, combining qualitative review and design science. Data will be collected from regulatory documentation, maturity models such as OWASP SAMM, and simulated DevSecOps pipeline metrics. Key skills required include the ability to conduct gap analyses, interpret regulatory frameworks, and design artefacts that align security automation with compliance requirements.

This proposal marks the transition from theoretical cybersecurity governance research (IIoT) to an applied framework for secure systems transformation within regulated environments.
