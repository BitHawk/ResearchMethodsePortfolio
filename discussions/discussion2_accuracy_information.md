# Collaborative Discussion 2 – Case Study on Accuracy of Information  
## Units 7–9  

## Initial Post – Accuracy, Integrity and Professional Responsibility  

The case of Abi, a statistical programmer tasked with analysing data for the manufacturer of the cereal *Whizzz*, raises fundamental ethical questions about accuracy, integrity, and professional responsibility in computing and research. Abi's recognition that alternative correlations could present the product in a more favourable light highlights a prevalent ethical quandary: the utilisation of valid data in a selective manner to substantiate a favoured account.
In accordance with the principles set out in the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), computing professionals are bound by three key commitments: the primary one being the obligation to "avoid harm"; the secondary one being the requirement to "be honest and trustworthy"; and the tertiary obligation being "respect the privacy and integrity of data". The manipulation of analyses to yield results that are technically sound but misleading is in violation of these principles, as it undermines truthfulness and public trust in research. The British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct similarly requires members to act with integrity, accurately present information, and avoid deceptive practices.
From a legal standpoint, the manipulation of data or the selective reporting of data could be considered as professional misconduct, and could also constitute a breach of consumer-protection laws such as the EU's General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) or national advertising regulations. From a social perspective, the concealment of negative health data has the potential to compromise consumer safety and erode public confidence in both scientific research and industry. Consequently, Abi is ethically bound to present all relevant results transparently, including those that may be unfavourable to the manufacturer.
In the event that the company chooses to suppress negative findings, it is Abi's professional obligation to report the full truth through the appropriate institutional channels, such as the ethics board of his institute or an independent regulatory body. The responsibility extends beyond the generation of code or statistical outputs; it encompasses the assurance that computing and analytical work supports accurate, socially responsible outcomes.

## Summary Post – Reflection and Peer Feedback  

In the course of the aforementioned discussion, the participants provided consistent feedback that statistical accuracy is inextricably linked to ethical responsibility. It was a commonly held view amongst participants that the role of Abi extends beyond the performance of computations; rather, it is the safeguarding of the integrity of the scientific process that is of primary importance. The prevailing opinion was that transparency, encompassing the reporting of both positive and negative results, is imperative for maintaining credibility and safeguarding public welfare.
This exchange resulted in the cultivation of a more profound appreciation for the intersection between professional ethics and legal accountability. Peers have drawn attention to real-world parallels in data-driven industries where selective analysis distorts public perception. It is evident that the concept of accuracy has undergone a transformation in its perception, being regarded not solely as a technical prerequisite but rather as a social contract between professionals and society.
The case demonstrates that ethical computing demands continuous critical evaluation of the collection, analysis and communication of data. The adherence to the ethical standards set forth by the ACM and BCS is instrumental in ensuring that the expertise in the field of technology is utilised for the greater good, rather than being driven by commercial or personal interests. Consequently, ethical reasoning constitutes an integral and continuous element of professional practice, rather than a supplementary consideration introduced after the attainment of results.
