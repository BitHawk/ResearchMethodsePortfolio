## Initial Post – Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct  
In the ACM case study entitled "Medical Implant Risk Analysis", the nascent company Corazón is responsible for the development of a wireless heart-monitor implant and associated smartphone application. Following the approval of the medical device under scrutiny, the company's research team discovered a proof-of-concept exploit developed by a security researcher. This exploit revealed a hard-coded initialisation value in the implant that enabled the reset of the device by nearby malicious devices. Notwithstanding the company's technical leaders' evaluation of the risk as "negligible", the situation gives rise to ethical concerns.
In the context of professional practice, the application of the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) gives rise to several pertinent obligations. The implications of Principle 1.1 (contributing to society and human well-being) are pertinent in this context, as the implant in question has a direct impact on patients' health. As indicated by the hard-coded value, there appears to have been an insufficient level of risk analysis. In light of this, it can be concluded that Principle 2.5 (which states that "comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computing systems must be carried out") is relevant in this particular context. As indicated in Section 2.9 of the Design and Implementation Principles, the necessity to create robust and secure systems is also called into question by the identified vulnerability. In the context of the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct, the professional computing practitioner must maintain integrity, be aware of risks to users, and act responsibly—ensuring safety and competence.
From a legal and social perspective, while the implant was regulatory-approved, the hard-coded issue may expose Corazón to liability under product-safety and medical-device laws (depending on jurisdiction). From a social perspective, an absence of acknowledgement or disclosure regarding such vulnerabilities can erode public confidence in implantable medical technology and in the professionals entrusted with its implementation. From a professional standpoint, the case demonstrates that computing practitioners cannot rely solely on regulatory clearance. Instead, they must proactively maintain secure and ethical design throughout a system's lifecycle.


## Summary Post – Reflection and Peer Feedback  
In the responses from peers, there was a strong emphasis that regulatory approval alone does not absolve professional responsibility. It was emphasised that the decision to designate the exploit risk as "negligible" still necessitated transparent communication with users and stakeholders. This feedback serves as a foundation for the assertion that both the ACM and BCS codes function as moral and practical guidelines, extending beyond the confines of mere compliance checklists. It is imperative that professionals continuously assess system risks, even in circumstances where certification has been established, and maintain transparency regarding potential hazards.
The case study lends further support to the notion that ethical computing is a dynamic concept, involving the anticipation of emerging threats (such as a nearby device exploit) and engagement with researchers when vulnerabilities are discovered. The symbiotic relationship between legal regulation and professional duty necessitates that computing professionals assume the role of stewards of trust for users, particularly within life-critical environments. This discussion has enhanced my understanding of the fact that ethical reflection in computing demands vigilance, communication, and a commitment to user welfare, rather than merely technical competence.
