# Statistics and Charts Summary  
## Units 8–9 – Inferential Statistics

The Unit 8 exercises introduced key inferential techniques for testing hypotheses and interpreting quantitative evidence. Each worksheet required extending a partial dataset with additional samples, recalculating descriptive statistics, and performing formal tests of significance.  

### Exercise 8.1B – One-Sample Comparison  
The data compared two diets (A and B) in terms of weight-loss outcomes. After adding data for Diet B, the test compared mean weight loss between the groups (Diet A ≈ 5.34 kg; Diet B ≈ 3.71 kg). A two-sample *t*-test indicated a measurable difference, with Diet A producing greater average loss. This exercise reinforced how hypothesis testing distinguishes genuine effects from random variation.

### Exercise 8.2B – Expanded Two-Sample Analysis  
The second worksheet repeated the comparison with additional summary metrics (median, quartiles, inter-quartile range). The test confirmed that Diet A still outperformed Diet B, while the overlapping ranges showed some natural variability. This highlighted the importance of examining distribution spread alongside mean differences.

### Exercise 8.3D – Categorical Association  
By inserting Area 2 data, the worksheet compared brand preference (A, B, Other) across two regions using a Chi-Square test of independence. The analysis showed that brand choice distributions differed between areas, illustrating how categorical tests identify relationships between non-numerical variables.

### Exercise 8.6C – Group Mean Comparison (Income by Sex)  
Additional records for “Sex M” and “Sex F” enabled a two-sample *t*-test comparing mean income. Males (M ≈ 52.9, SD ≈ 15.3) reported higher averages than females (F ≈ 44.2, SD ≈ 13.8). The resulting *p*-value was below 0.05, indicating a statistically significant difference. This example demonstrated how inferential methods reveal group disparities while controlling for random error.

### Interpretation and Reflection  
Completing these analyses clarified how inferential statistics move beyond description to evidence-based decision-making. Understanding *p*-values, confidence levels, and test selection ensures that analytical conclusions are transparent and reproducible. Professionally, these techniques support data-driven risk assessment, performance benchmarking, and audit validation—skills essential in cybersecurity and compliance contexts.

# Charts and Data Visualisation Summary  
## Unit 9 – Chart Construction and Interpretation  

The Unit 9 exercises demonstrated how statistical results can be presented visually for clearer interpretation. Each activity applied chart design principles to compare categorical and continuous data effectively.  

### Exercises 9.1D – 9.2D  
Bar and clustered column charts were created to show brand preferences across two areas. The individual charts highlighted that “Other” brands dominated both markets, while the combined chart made inter-area differences immediately visible. Brands A and B were slightly more popular in Area 2. These tasks reinforced the value of side-by-side comparison and consistent scaling in ethical data presentation.  

### Exercise 9.3B  
Histograms were generated for two diet programmes using grouped weight-loss data. Both distributions appeared roughly symmetric, with Diet A showing a slightly higher central tendency and lower dispersion than Diet B. Plotting relative frequencies clarified differences in spread without misleading axis manipulation.  

### Reflection  
This unit emphasised how visualisation transforms numeric results into accessible insights. Clear labelling, uniform axes, and proportionate scaling are essential for maintaining accuracy and trust. Professionally, these skills are transferable to risk dashboards and audit reporting, where visual clarity supports transparent, data-driven decision-making.
